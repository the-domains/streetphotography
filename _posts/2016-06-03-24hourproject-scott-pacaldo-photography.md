The Book:

A photo book edition of my selected photos for the official \#24HourProject Cebu Edition. This showcases the streets of Cebu, and a glimpse of the daily Cebu life through photos.

The updated version is now in 8x8 format which consists of 24 selected photos, with the 30+ 'Outtake shots' now included. Content and Layout redesigned.

The book is printed on FSC-certified and acid free paper. 88 pages of quality images in Perfect Bound. Magcloud prints the content on 80\# text stock, while the cover is printed on a heavier 80\# cover stock with a satin UV coating.

_The \#24HourProject book serves as a memento of the photographer for his hometown, Cebu.  
A must-have for Cebuanos, and Photography enthusiasts._
